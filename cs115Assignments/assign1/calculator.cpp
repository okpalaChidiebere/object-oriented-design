programming algorithm:This program carries out the mathematical problems:
addition, subtraction, division, multiplication and power
-the user inputs the number and symbol when the scan_data function is called
-does the operations required by the user by calling do_next_op function and scans the input again fron the error while, 'q' and '0' is not entered
note: -the main finction gives the user another chance if division by zero is entered
-the function scan_data tells the user the error when division by zero is entered
